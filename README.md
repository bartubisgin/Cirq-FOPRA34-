# FOPRA34: Simulating Quantum Many-body Dynamics on a Current Digital Computer

This repository contains my code for the Advanced Lab Course on 'Simulating Quantum Many-body Dyanmics on a Current Digital Quantum Computer'. The advanced lab course (FOPRA) is a part of the Quantum Science & Technology MSc program at TUM/LMU. 

The lab was divided into two separate days, each of which has its own guide and problem sets. The lab book for each can be found in the 'lab-book' directory.
