# FOPRA34: Simulating Quantum Many-body Dynamics on a Current Digital Computer

This repository contains my code for the Advanced Lab Course on 'Simulating Quantum Many-body Dyanmics on a Current Digital Quantum Computer'. The advanced lab course (FOPRA) is a part of the Quantum Science & Technology MSc program at TUM/LMU. 

The aim of this advanced lab course was to get familiar with using Cirq, and also tap into some advanced methods relevant for cutting-edge quantum information and quantum simulation research. The scripts include the following:

## Day 1
* Basics of Cirq
* Quantum Teleportation
* Rabi Oscillations
* Single-qubit Tomography
* Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with simple grid
* Noise in VQE

## Day 2
* Classical Magnetization of Transverse-Field Ising (TFI) Model
* Trotterization of TFI
* Extraction of Loschmidt Rates for Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions (DQPT)
* Entanglement Tracking (Von Neumann and Renyi)
* Noise Effects


The lab book for each can be found in the 'lab-book' directory.
